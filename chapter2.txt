 Chapter Two: A Price for Hope

Excitement surged through him as he clicked on the ad. The idea of earning money by simply reading news was like a lifeline thrown to him in the middle of a storm. It seemed too good to be true, and perhaps it was. But in his desperation, he was willing to believe in the possibility. The website was simple and straightforward, offering details about how users could sign up and start earning. For a moment, Isuho’s heart lifted—this could be the way out he had been waiting for.

But just as quickly as hope had risen, it was dashed. As he navigated the registration process, he encountered an obstacle: a mandatory registration fee. His heart sank. The fee wasn’t large by ordinary standards, but for someone in Isuho’s dire situation, it was a significant sum. He didn’t have the money, and the opportunity that had seemed so promising now felt like it was slipping away before his very eyes.

For a while, he sat in silence, staring blankly at the screen, tempted to give up. The thought lingered, but then he remembered the other options available to him—choices that didn’t require any upfront payment, but whose costs might be far higher than he could handle. In comparison, scraping together the fee for this opportunity seemed like a minor challenge. Determined not to let it slip away, Isuho resolved to save the money, even if it meant making sacrifices.

His mind turned to the small amount of money his father gave him each week for food. It wasn’t much—just enough to keep him going—but if he was careful, maybe he could set aside a little bit each day. It wouldn’t be easy. The thought of eating even less than he already was made his stomach churn, but it was the only option he had.

And so, Isuho began a month-long routine of self-denial. Every day, he set aside a portion of his meager food allowance, cutting his meals down to almost nothing. Hunger became a constant companion, gnawing at him day and night. There were moments when he wondered if it was worth it, if he should just give up and take Other’s offer instead. But each time, he pushed the thought away. This was a path he had chosen, a way to make money without compromising who he was.

Finally, after weeks of scrimping and saving, Isuho had enough. The day he transferred the money to complete his registration, his hands were trembling, not just from hunger but from the overwhelming sense of accomplishment. He had done it. The registration process was simple, and soon enough, he received confirmation that he was now part of the program. The promise of earning money, however small, filled him with a sense of purpose he hadn’t felt in a long time.

As he waited for the next step, Isuho allowed himself a moment of relief. He had made progress, choosing a path that didn’t involve the risks he had been warned about. But even as he tried to unwind, the memory of that recent encounter lingered in his mind. The road ahead was still uncertain, and Isuho couldn’t shake the feeling that this was just the beginning of a much longer journey.
