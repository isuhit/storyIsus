 Chapter One: A Desperate Pursuit


Isuho was lost in thought, sitting in his small, dimly lit apartment, pondering the seemingly impossible task of making money. The bills piled up on the table across the room, a constant reminder of his struggles. He had tried everything he could think of, but no matter how hard he worked, it was never enough. The weight of his circumstances bore down on him heavily, trapping him in a cycle that seemed unbreakable.

His parents had faced the same hardships, and now, it felt as though he was destined to follow in their footsteps, with no way out. Days blended into nights as Isuho searched for a solution, but every idea led to a dead end. The city around him was a constant reminder of opportunities missed and doors closed. He longed for a chance, a break that would lift him from the depths of despair, but each day passed without change.

The hope he once held onto was slipping away, replaced by a growing sense of hopelessness. His bank account was dwindling, and the thought of asking his parents for help again made his stomach turn. He felt like a failure, like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of poverty and disappointment. But then, one day, as he scrolled through his phone, something caught his eye.

It was an ad, simple and direct: "Read news and get paid." The promise seemed almost too good to be true, but it sparked something in Isuho a flicker of excitement he hadnâ€™t felt in a long time. The idea of earning money by simply reading news felt like a lifeline, something he could easily do. His heart raced at the thought of finally finding a way out of his financial troubles.

But even as excitement began to build, a whisper of doubt crept into his mind. Could something so straightforward really be the answer to his problems? Was it truly as easy as it sounded, or was there a catch? Isuho hesitated, torn between the potential for a fresh start and the fear of being disappointed once again. The offer was tempting, almost irresistible, and yet the uncertainty gnawed at him.

Despite his reservations, Isuho decided to give it a try. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain. As he clicked on the link, a small glimmer of hope began to grow within him. This might be the chance he had been waiting for, the opportunity to break free from the chains of poverty and hardship. Little did he know, this seemingly simple decision would set him on a path that would change his life in ways he could never have imagined.
